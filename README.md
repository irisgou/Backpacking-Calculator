# Backpacking Energy Expenditure Calculator

## Overview

The Backpacking Energy Spend Calculator is a full-stack web application designed to estimate the calories burned while hiking, taking into account various factors such as body weight, pack weight, hiking speed, incline grade, and terrain type. The application is built using React for the frontend, Flask for the backend API, and is styled with Tailwind CSS.

Users can input their body weight, pack weight, hiking speed, incline grade, and terrain type to calculate the calories burned per hour and total calories burned during the hike.

This calculator is based on Pandolf, K. B., Givoni, B., & Goldman, R. F. (1977). Predicting endurance in hot environments. Journal of Applied Physiology, 43(4), 577-581.
